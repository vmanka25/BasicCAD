## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description

The second thing I had to make was the base. the dimensions were 120 mm by 120 mm and 8mm thick. It had 4 10mm holes in a square, and a 25mm hole in the middle

I am don't know how to add the image

### Reflection

This was my second part and it was pretty easy. I learned how to use the pattern feature for sketches

## Fork

### Description

The fork is my third part that I made it is made with 2 cylinders, and 2 parts that the wheel will go through

This was probably the hardest part, so far and I learned how to use the plane tool better. I needed to use the plane tool to make a hole through the wheel holders.

## Tire

### Description

This will be the tire of the caster. It has an outer diameter of 110 mm, and an inner diameter, of 80mm. It has rounded edges.

### Reflection

this part was fun but challenging to make, I didn't read the instructions all the way through so it took me a while to center the sketch, but I made it work. I learned that you can center things on a line by making two lines on each side then setting them equal to each other. I don't know if thats the fastest way though.
